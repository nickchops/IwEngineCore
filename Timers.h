 * @class Timer
 *
 * @brief A timer can be used to time the duration of events as well as create delays in-game
 *
 * Below is a short example showing how to use a timer
 * @code
 *    // Create the timer
 *    Timer timer1;
 *
 *    // Elsewhere in our code we start a 2 second timer
 *    timer1.setDuration(2000, true);
 *
 *    // Elsewhere in our code we check to see if the timer has expired
 *    if (timer1.HasTimedOut())
 *    {
 *        // Do something
 8    }
 * @endcode
